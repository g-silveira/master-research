In the present experiment, Minnesotan and Southern Californian speakers read two dialogs which included four levels of emphasis. Emphasis lengthened segmental duration, raised the scaling of all tones and delayed H alignment in L+H*. Independently of emphasis effects, in both dialects L+H* and L*+H were used in different contexts and were phonetically distinct, with L*+H showing later alignment of both tones, lower scaling of L, and higher scaling of H. In addition, there were phonetic differences between the two dialects, with Southern Californian showing later alignment than Minnesotan English. On the other hand, our data indicate that Minnesotan speakers may lack the H* : L+H* contrast: in one of the dialogs, Minnesotan speakers used L+H* irrespective of emphasis, while Southern Californian speakers switched from H* to L+H* with increased emphasis. These results suggest that Pierrehumbert's three-way distinction between H*, L*+H and L+H* is essentially correct, though it may not apply to all the dialects of American English.},

Eight participants per language produced speech using three elicitation methods, spontaneous speech, story reading and reading a set of sentences divided into ``uncontrolled'' sentences from original works of each language, and sentences devised to maximize or minimize syllable structure complexity (``stress-timed'' and ``syllable-timed'' sets respectively). Rhythm classifications based on pooled data were inconsistent across metrics, while cross-linguistic differences in scores were often statistically non-significant even for comparisons between prototypical languages like English and Spanish. Metrics showed substantial inter-speaker variation and proved very sensitive to elicitation method and syllable complexity, so that the size of both effects was large and often comparable to that of language. These results suggest that any cross-linguistic differences captured by metrics are not robust; metric scores range substantially within a language and are readily affected by a variety of methodological decisions, making cross-linguistic comparisons and rhythmic classifications based on metrics unsafe at best.},

The differences are small but significant. Moreover, native patterns of alignment are carried over into the German speakers' pronunciation of English. These findings argue against interpreting cross-language alignment differences in terms of distinct patterns of phonological association, and in favor of describing them in terms of quantitative phonetic realization rules.},

  abstract = {O objeto espec\'ifico desta pesquisa de mestrado \'e investigar qual o modelo pros\'odico inicial na aquisi{\c c}\~ao do portugu\^es brasileiro (doravante PB) e a poss\'ivel influ\^encia da metodologia utilizada nos resultados. Partindo da pressuposi{\c c}\~ao de que h\'a uma gram\'atica inicial, dada pela gram\'atica universal (CHOMSKY, 1981), autores que lidam com l\'inguas germ\^anicas afirmam que o troqueu \'e o modelo pros\'odico default na aquisi{\c c}\~ao (cf. GERKEN, 1994; FIKKERT, 1994), e o mesmo \'e defendido por estudos que lidam com outras fam\'ilias ling\"u\'isticas (cf. ADAM \& BAT-EL, 2007 para o hebraico; PRIETO, 2005 para o catal\~ao, por exemplo). No entanto, os dados infantis do PB trazem complica{\c c}\~oes para a suposta tend\^encia trocaica universal, pois estudos observacionais (natural\'isticos) encontram uma tend\^encia i\^ambica (SANTOS, 2001, 2007; BONILHA, 2004; BAIA, 2006). Apesar de haver no cen\'ario da literatura brasileira debates e estudos recentes a respeito do modelo pros\'odico inicial (cf. RAPP, 1994; BONILHA, 2004; SANTOS, 2006, 2007), algumas quest\~oes ainda permanecem. A maior parte desses trabalhos \'e composta por estudos observacionais e n\~ao experimentais, o contr\'ario do que normalmente acontece na literatura estrangeira. O \'unico estudo experimental no PB conhecido at\'e ent\~ao \'e o de Rapp (1994), o qual afirma haver uma tend\^encia trocaica nos dados iniciais do PB. Enquanto a autora aponta uma tend\^encia trocaica, nenhum estudo observacional a confirma; ao contr\'ario, estes estudos levantam ind\'icios a favor de uma tend\^encia i\^ambica inicial (BONILHA, 2004; SANTOS, 2006, 2007; BAIA, 2006). Logo a pesquisa aqui conduzida visa verificar se h\'a influ\^encia da metodologia empregada nos resultados apresentados pela literatura brasilera. Para isso, nesta disserta{\c c}\~ao, s\~ao utilizadas as duas metodologias na an\'alise dos dados (a experimental e a observacional): no estudo experimental, s\~ao analisados dados de 42 crian{\c c}as na faixa et\'aria de 1;5 3;0 anos, e no estudo observacional, s\~ao analisados dados de uma crian{\c c}a (LUI) na mesma faixa et\'aria do estudo experimental. Os resultados obtidos por meio dos dois estudos realizados nesta pesquisa corroboram o que \'e afirmado pelo estudo experimental de Rapp (1994) e pelos estudos observacionais (SANTOS, 2006, 2007; BONILHA, 2004; BAIA, 2006). Dessa maneira, os resultados apresentam a mesma discrep\^ancia a respeito da tend\^encia pros\'odica inicial presente na compara{\c c}\~ao entre os estudos que adotam diferentes m\'etodos. No entanto, foi encontrada uma explica{\c c}\~ao para o que ocasiona tal discrep\^ancia. Notou-se que os iambos diminuem se o l\'exico particular e os verbos s\~ao exclu\'idos dos dados. Sem o l\'exico particular e verbos, h\'a uma predomin\^ancia de SW em DES e DEX. Dessa maneira, a diferen{\c c}a entre os resultados do estudo experimental e dos estudos observacionais est\'a relacionada com a metodologia empregada e, particularmente, com o invent\'ario lexical e classe gramatical considerados na an\'alise. Por fim, acredita-se que o estudo que desconsidere todos os tipos de produ{\c c}\~oes infantis n\~ao pode afirmar, categoricamente, uma outra tend\^encia inicial. Por essa raz\~ao, afirma-se que o PB apresenta uma tend\^encia i\^ambica inicial, tend\^encia defendida pelos estudos observacionais (BAIA, 2006; SANTOS, 2007) que lidam com a produ{\c c}\~ao lexical infantil na sua totalidade, embora n\~ao se trate de uma tend\^encia forte e seja apenas uma tend\^encia aparente de acordo com os resultados estat\'isticos deste estudo.

            ABSTRACT This work presents a study of Brazilian Portuguese pre-stressed vowels in penultimate, trisyllabic words with four informants, two from Campinas region (South-Eastern) and two from Recife (North-Eastern Brazil). A corpus of 58 familiar and unfamiliar words within carrier phrases evaluated the duration, F1 and F2 frequencies of pre-stressed and stressed vowels. The goal was to examine vowel harmony as a possible consequence of Vowel-to-Vowel anticipatory coarticulation. Results point to asymmetries of vowel harmony: its frequency is higher in familiar words; in Recife, the harmony with low and mid-low stressed vowels is more frequent; stressed /u/ triggers less harmony than the other stressed vowels and pre-stressed /e/ undergoes more harmony than pre-stressed /o/.},

  abstract = {The study of durational patterns of utterances in a language is viewed under the framework of a couple-oscillators dynamical model of speech rhythm production. This model has two main components: a two-coupled-oscillator model (a syllabic and a phrase stress oscillator) and an integrated gestural score specifying the coordination between abstract gestures. The phrase stress oscillator deals with the metrical component of the model by delimitating stress groups, the syllabic oscillator imposes a vowel flow continuum along the entire utterance, and the integrated gestural score is the domain where non-derivational lexical contrasts take place. In the model framework, two techniques allowing the systematisation of rhythm typology research under a dynamical perspective are presented. The first technique is the automatic detection of stress group boundaries from analysis of patterns of syllable-sized durations, and the second is the estimation of model parameters from inversion of the equations describing period coupling.},

The results reproduce the early findings on rhythm typology for these languages/varieties with the following advantages: it successfully accounts for speech rate variation, related to the syllabic oscillator frequency in the model; it takes only syllable-sized units into account, not spliting syllables into vowels and consonants; the consequences of phrase stress magnitude on stress group duration are directly considered; both universal and language-specific aspects of speech rhythm are captured by the model.},

            This paper examines the indexical value of /s/-fronting in White Afrikaans and in White South African English (WSAfE). Prior research on this feature has shown that fronted articulations of /s/ in WSAfE serve as a regional and social indicator of the wealthy northern suburbs of Johannesburg, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the feature carries a similar meaning in White Afrikaans. This study therefore aims to examine whether the variable carries similar meanings across the two languages. Data are based on the evaluative reactions toward different experimental stimuli that were presented to 214 Afrikaans-English bilinguals in South Africa during a modified matched-guise task. The results indicate that /s/-fronting in a man's voice is perceived in similar terms in White Afrikaans and WSAfE though it carries somewhat different meanings across the two languages when it occurs in a woman's voice, a difference related in turn to different approaches to gender across the two speech communities. The results of this research, and the indexical value of /s/-fronting in the two languages, are therefore only understandable in terms of certain sociohistorical and sociological differences between the two speech communities. The article ends with some discussion relating to the possible source of the relevant similarities and differences, i.e., parallel innovation or sociophonetic transfer.},

In Section 1, ``Introduction'', basic concepts of intonation and prosody are summarised and cornerstones of intonation research are highlighted. In Section 2, ``Functions and forms of intonation'', a wide range of functions from morpholexical and phrase levels to discourse and dialogue levels are discussed and forms of intonation with examples from different languages are presented. In Section 3, ``Modelling and labelling of intonation'', established models of intonation as well as labelling systems are presented. In Section 4, ``Applications of intonation'', the most widespread applications of intonation and especially technological ones are presented and methodological issues are discussed. In Section 5, ``Research perspective'' research avenues and ultimate goals as well as the significance and benefits of intonation research in the upcoming years are outlined.
Zusammenfassung
Dieser \"Uberblicksartikel richtet sich an eine breite Leserschaft aus unterschiedlichen Disziplinen und mit unterschiedlichem Kenntnisstand hinsichtlich der Intonationsforschung. Der Beitrag ist in f\"unf Abschnitte gegliedert. In Abschnitt 1, ``Introduction'', werden die grundlegenden Konzepte der Prosodie und Intonation und die wichtigsten Richtungen der Intonationsforschung skizziert. Eine Bandbreite von Funktionen der Intonation, von der morpholexikalischen und Phrasenebene bis zur Ebene des Diskurses und Dialogs, werden in Abschnitt 2, ``Functions and forms of intonation'', diskutiert, und Formen der Intonation werden anhand von Beispielen aus verschiedenen Sprachen illustriert. In Abschnitt 3, ``Modelling and labelling of intonation'', werden etablierte Intonationsmodelle sowie Systeme der Annotation und Etikettierung intonatorischer Merkmale pr\"asentiert. Die am weitesten verbreiteten Anwendungen der Intonation, mit einem Schwerpunkt auf der Sprachtechnologie, werden in Abschnitt 4, ``Applications of intonation'', vorgestellt, und es werden einige methodische Probleme diskutiert. Schlie\ss{}lich werden in Abschnitt 5, ``Research perspectives'', m\"ogliche Richtungen und Ziele f\"ur zuk\"unftige Forschungsarbeiten auf dem Gebiet der Intonation aufgezeigt.
R\'esum\'e
Cet article de synth\`ese s'adresse \`a un large public provenant de diff\'erentes disciplines mais \'egalement aux sp\'ecialistes de l'intonation. Il comprend cinq parties. Dans la premi\`ere partie, ou Introduction, sont bri\`evement rappel\'es les concepts de base de l'intonation et de la prosodie et mises en lumi\`ere les p\'eriodes charni\`eres de la recherche intonative. Dans la deuxi\`eme partie, Fonctions et formes de l'intonation, un large \'eventail des fonctions des niveaux morpholexical, phrastique, discursif ou dialogal est examin\'e; des formes intonatives provenant de langues diff\'erentes sont pr\'esent\'ees et compar\'ees. Dans la troisi\`eme partie, Mod\'elisation et transcription de l'intonation, on fait r\'ef\'erence aux mod\`eles courants de l'intonation et aux syst\`emes d'\'etiquetage op\'erationnels. Dans la quatri\`eme partie, Les applications de l'intonation, sont pr\'esent\'ees les applications les plus courantes de l'intonation, plus particuli\`erement les applications technologiques; une discussion est engag\'ee sur les probl\`emes m\'ethodologiques. Dans la cinqui\`eme partie, Perspectives de recherche, des directions de recherche sont trac\'ees; on pr\'ecise les buts \`a atteindre et on souligne le sens et l'int\'er\^et de la recherche intonative pour les ann\'ees \`a venir.},

Recorded interviews from 75 inhabitants of Porirua, a small city north of Wellington, were analyzed for the use of HRTs. The speaker sample was subdivided according to years of age (20\textendash{}29, 40\textendash{}49, 70\textendash{}79), sex, ethnicity (Maori and Pakeha), and class (working and middle). The results show that linguistic change is in progress, the use of HRTs being favored by young Maori and by young Pakeha women. The results are explained in terms of the function of HRTs as positive politeness markers. The usefulness of the term ``linguistic variable'' in the analysis of intonational change and discourse features is assessed.},

This chapter aims to explain and exemplify that link by examining the linguistic consequences of brief, short-term contacts, of more prolonged and longer-term contacts, of linguistic accommodation and second dialect acquisition at the level of the individual, and of new dialect formation at the level of the community. Later, the chapter examines what happened in the longer term-second dialect acquisition, interdialect forms and new dialect formation. Work in second dialect acquisition has tended to focus on individual migrants moving to new communities where a relatively distinct and focused ambient dialect prevails. Dialect contact theorists argue the challenge approaches to sociolinguistic principles apply in these situations as occur in the shorter-term and/or individual migrant forms of contact. This, together with humans' seemingly innate behavioral convergence, allowed dialect contact models to explain the changes.},

(1999) a number of statistical metrics have been routinely employed by researchers (Ramus 2003, Grabe \& Low 2002 etc.) in an effort to rhythmically classify languages. However, recent studies by Arvaniti (2009), Tilsen \& Arvaniti (2013), Arvaniti \& Rodriquez (2013) etc., have challenged both the validity of these metrics in reflecting speech rhythm, and the physical measurability of rhythm itself. The present study takes a comparative evaluative approach, and explores the applicability of the proposed metrics to a Papuan language (Urama) with a phonology quite different than traditional Western European (W.E.) languages. It is argued here that the statistical underpinning of the existing rhythm metrics is a direct outcome of an overt effort to capture the temporal durational characteristics of the phonotactics of W.E. languages. As such, these metrics are only capable of providing a crude measure of timing.},

  abstract = {An accurate database documentation at phonetic level is very important for speech research: however, manual segmentation and labeling is a time consuming and error prone task. This article describes an automatic procedure for the segmentation of speech: given either the linguistic or the phonetic content of a speech utterance, the system provides phone boundaries. The technique is based on the use of an acoustic-phonetic unit Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizer: both the recognizer and the segmentation system have been designed exploiting the DARPA-TIMIT acoustic-phonetic continuous speech database of American English. Segmentation and labeling experiments have been conducted in different conditions to check the reliability of the resulting system. Satisfactory results have been obtained, especially when the system is trained with some manually presegmented material. The size of this material is a crucial factor; system performance has been evaluated with respect to this parameter. It turns out that the system provides 88.3\% correct boundary location, given a tolerance of 20 ms, when only 256 phonetically balanced sentences are used for its training.
Zusammenfassung
Eine Sorgf\"altige phonetische Datensammlung ist f\"ur die Spracherkennung sehr wichtig: die manuelle Segmentierung und Etikettierung ist jedoch eine zeitraubende und Fehlern unterworpene Aufgabe. Diesel Artikel beschreibt ein automatisches Verfahren zur Sprachsegmentierung: wenn entweder sprachliche oder der phonetische Inhalt des Sprachsignals gegeben sind, liefert das System phonetische Segmente. Basis dieser Technik ist ein Spracherkennungssystem, das die akustisch-phonetischen Einheiten zun\"achst mit Hilfe eines Hidden-Markov-Models (HMM) identifiziert: sowohl der Spacherkenner als auch das Segmentierungssystem wurden anhand der akustisch-phonetischen Datensammlung der englisch-amerikanischen stetigen Sprache DARPA-TIMIT entwickelt. Segmentierungs- und Etikettierungs-experimente wurden unter verschiedenen Bedingungen angestellt, um die mit diesem System erreichten Ergebnissen zu erproben. Befriedigende Ergebnisse wurden erzielt, vor allem wenn das System auf manuell presegmentiertes Material trainiert wurde. Daraus ergibt sich, dass das System die Position der Segmeente mit 88.3\% Genauigkeit berechnet, mit einer Toleranz von 20 ms, wenn nur 256 phonetisch ausgewogene S\"atze f\"ur das Training ben\"utzt werden.
R\'esum\'e
Disposer de descriptions phon\'etiques pr\'ecises de bases de donn\'ees de parole est essentiel pour la recherche en traitement automatique de la parole: toutefois, la segmentation et l'\'etiquetage manuels sont des t\^aches longues et sujettes \`a erreurs. Dans cet article, nous pr\'esentons une m\'ethode de segmentation automatique de la parole. Etant donn\'ee une transcription phon\'etique ou une transcription orthographique, notre syst\`eme fournit la segmentation phon\'etique correspondante. Cette m\'ethode est bas\'ee sur l'utilisation d'un syst\`eme.de reconnaissance de parole utilisant les cha\^ines de Markov cach\'ees (Hidden Markov Models, HMM) pour mod\'eliser les unit\'es acoustico-phon\'etiques. La base de donn\'ees am\'ericaines DARPA-TIMIT a \'et\'e utilis\'ee pour l'apprentissage et le test du syst\`eme. Pour \'evaluer notre syst\`eme,d es exp\'eriences de segmentation et de transcription phon\'etique ont \'et\'e effectu\'ees dans diff\'erentes conditions. Des r\'esultats satisfaisants ont \'et\'e obtenus, en particulier lorsque le syst\`eme est entrain\'e avec des signaux pr\'ealablement segment\'es manuellement. La taille de ce corpus d'apprentissage joue un r\^ole important: les performances du syst\`eme ont \'et\'e \'evalu\'ees en fonction de ce param\`etre. Lorsque l'apprentissage est effectu\'e avec seulement 256 phon\'etiquement \'equilibr\'ees, le taux de fronti\`eres phon\'etiques correctement positionn\'ees, avec une marge de 20 ms, est de 88.3\%.},

              This study investigates how linguistic variation carries social meaning, examining the impact of the English variable (ING) on perceptions of eight speakers from the U.S. West Coast and South. Thirty-two excerpts of spontaneous speech were digitally manipulated to vary only in tokens of (ING) and used to collect listener perceptions in group interviews (
              N
              ~=~55) and an experiment (
              N
              ~=~124). Interview data and experimental results show that (ING) impacts social perception variably, inhabiting an indexical field of related meanings (Eckert, Penelope. [2008]. Variation and the indexical field.
              Journal of Sociolinguistics
              12(4):453\textendash{}476). One of these meanings, intelligence/education, is explored in detail to understand how a given meaning is realized or not in a specific context. Speakers were heard as less educated/intelligent when they used
              -in
              , but this effect is driven by reactions to speakers heard as aregional and not as working-class. Some implications on our future understanding of the processing of socially laden variation are discussed.},

              Traditionally used as a ``heuristic device'' (Labov, 1978), the sociolinguistic variable has taken on a new role as a primitive of speaker/hearer mental models in third-wave variation work (Eckert, 2005, 2008). Results from a sociolinguistic perception study suggest that at least in some cases, variants of the same variable function independently as loci of indexically linked social meaning. Listener responses were collected to three matched guises of the English variable (ING):
              -in
              ,
              -ing
              , and a neutral guise with no audible (ING) tokens. The results counter the study hypothesis that listener expectation, triggered by speaker regional accent, would shape (ING)'s impact. Instead, the two variants showed distinct social associations: the
              -ing
              guises were rated as more intelligent/educated, more articulate, and less likely to be a student than either the
              -in
              or neutral guises, which did not differ significantly. In contrast,
              -in
              guises made speakers sound less formal and less likely to be gay than the
              -ing
              and neutral guises, which did not differ. These results suggest that third-wave work needs to more closely examine the role of the variable in theorizing the relationship between linguistic and social structures.},

While perceptual studies have long played a role in the study of linguistic variation, they have not enjoyed central status, in contrast to their widespread use in the field of language attitudes.

Three threads of research on sociolinguistic perception are discussed: the social and affective evaluation of language, the identification of social information from speech and the influence of social information on linguistic comprehension. Finally, methodological and theoretical developments within the field of variation are explored that place perceptual studies at the heart of the variationist enterprise.},

Conversational speech was analyzed for prosodic rhythm using the Pairwise Variability Index (Low \& Grabe 1995), which included for each speaker at least 200 syllable-to- syllable comparisons in each language in order to determine the actual quantitative differences between Spanish and English. Additionally, the English data were compared to the data in the Thomas and Carter (2003 a, b) corpus in order to determine the rhythmic differences between North Carolina Hispanics and the benchmark non-Spanish-speaking, native English-speaking community. Finally, the Raleigh corpus provides access to monolingual Spanish speakers whose data will be used to examine the differences in Spanish among monolingual and bilingual Spanish speakers, shedding light on possible influences of English on the Spanish of Raleigh bilinguals. As expected, initial findings show that the rhythm associated with Hispanic English is, in fact substantially more syllable-timed than the English of non-Hispanics, while the rhythm associated with the Spanish of the Raleigh bilinguals is significantly more syllable-timed than the English of either group. Differences, however, are gradient, and there is considerable inter-speaker variability among speakers within these communities.},

The data consist of relative frequencies of rule application for different types of input string, and they provide a check on the frequencies predicted by variable rules. This study supports the hypothesis that the various features in rule structural descriptions tend to act independently, in the statistical sense, on rule probabilities. The analytic framework for variable rules is easily and naturally extendable to take into account the effect of sociolinguistic and stylistic features on application frequencies.},

Significant effects of talker gender were also observed on the distributions of pitch accents and phrasal\textendash{}boundary tone combinations.

The study further examines whether regional dialects form different groupings based on their segmental vs. global temporal characteristics. Acoustic measures included articulation rate, pause frequency and duration, and vowel and consonant duration variability. The results revealed that Southern American English is characterized by a slow overall articulation rate, long pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable vowel durations, whereas the New England dialect is characterized by a fast overall articulation rate, short pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable consonant durations. The patterns for the other dialects are more mixed: the Northern and Western dialects are characterized by low variability vowel durations, the Midland dialect shares a slow articulation rate with the Southern dialect, and the Mid-Atlantic dialect exhibits no unique temporal properties among those examined. Thus, temporal variation in regional dialects of American English is orthogonal to vowel variation, in which New England, Midland, and Western dialects are often characterized together as ``General American''. Taken together, the results are consistent with the stereotype that Southerners talk slowly and Northerners talk quickly and suggest that pausing and segmental duration variability may contribute to the perceived speaking rate differences.},

Perhaps the most important innovation was the apparent-time construct, a surrogate for the real-time examination of data at different points in history. Over the last 30 years linguists have used the apparent-time construct in many situations to make inferences about ongoing changes. Researchers desiring to use real-time evidence for studying language change have two options: (i) comparison of evidence from a new study to some pre-existing data, or (ii) re-survey of a community or a group of informants after a time-lapse. Researchers should be careful when making assumptions based on apparent-time data from adolescents and teenagers, and they must be alert both to the possible effects of sociolectal adjustments and to age-grading with adult cohorts.},

Description is supported by experimental analysis and phonological models of the metric auto-segmental theoretical lme. On the acoustical-experimental issue, I characterize the behavior of parameters such as duration, intensity and pitch, usmg CECIL computer program as speech analysis tool and usmg three different methodological procedures: 1) Data analysis from the five cities, collected from direct listening (criteria was the accent perception mark), and collected in ten recordings - five from the NURC Project and five out of a same text, read by an informant of the female sex of each city, 2) Data analysis from the five cities collected according to the context of the occurrence - end of Tonal Unity, with emphasis m the Bahia and Rio speeches, through a corpus of 24 recordings (12 from the NURC Project - three male and three female Rio subjects, also three male and three female Bahia subjects - and 12 out of readings, with equal sex distribution); 3) Comparative analysis of the chosen utterances, with no preoccupation regarding quantity, with the sole purpose of observing the quality of identifying marks of an accent Description shows that when facing the multiplicity of tonal variables some prosodic patterns fundamental to the proper functioning of a language are common to all the samples. The duration parameter is fixed as the identifier of the stressed syllable, the presence of the declination line characterizing the final assertive context, the melodic ascending pre-stressed pattem to the stressed pattern characterizing yes-no questions. On the other hand, results point out that pitch parameters and intensity are the main responsible for regional distinction, determining pre-stressed syllables prominence on Northeastern speeches, of the stressed syllable in Southern speech (Rio Grande do Sul) and conferring some Northeastern and Southern characteristics to S\~ao Paulo and Rio's speeches, which definitely gives them intersection sites attributes. Above all I demonstrate that the phenomena is intermittent, and that although regional speech perception is prosodically comprehensible to most Brazilian Portuguese speakers, there are more coincidences than differences in the tonal field.},

  date = {2003-01-01},
  abstract = {This paper provides a preliminary account of features of the intonation structure of three Irish dialects, Donegal (Ulster Irish), Mayo, and Aran Islands, using the IViE system [1, 2]. The sentence types examined were declarative and interrogative sentences: for the latter yes/no questions and wh-questions. The picture that emerges suggests that in intonation terms we are dealing with two rather than three dialects. The first we broadly term Connaught Irish (to include Mayo and Aran Islands, which despite fairly striking segmental differences have very similar prosodic properties). These differ strikingly from the Donegal dialect in terms of the realisation of the pitch accent. For example in declarative sentences, whereas Connaught Irish is characterised by a predominantly H* pitch accent, with downstep, the Donegal pattern is predominantly L*+H. The questions arises as to whether such apparently dissimilar patterns might be regarded as similar at an underlying level, differing in terms of the time alignment of the tonal material relative to the syllabic nucleus. This potential analysis is modelled on the treatment by Bruce and G\aa{}rding [3] of word tones in Swedish dialects. The similarities of the Donegal (Ulster) patterns with those described by Grabe et al. [4] for Belfast English are also discussed, as well as the likelihood of language contact as an explanation for the latter.},

Consequently, this study has examined the speech of younger female speakers in St. John's to determine whether or not parental origin plays a significant  role in the acquisition and use of local phonological features. -- The results of quantitative analysis indicate that with little exception, non-local-parent speakers appear  to acquire local dialect features. However, these speakers tend to use more General Canadian features, especially when these are innovative, and fewer local features, than their peers with local parents do. These results indicate that in St. John's, dialect acquisition is not strictly a matter of mastering local phonological, morphological, and lexical constraints. Instead, the social evaluation of dialect features appears to be the critical factor. Moreover, the stylistic profiles of the two parental origin groups differ;  local-parent speakers exhibit a greater degree of stylistic variation than do those with non-local-parents.},

In this context it has been found that especially deltaC varies considerably as a function of speech rate (Barry et al., 2003 and Dellwo \& Wagner, 2003). The present paper argues that if deltaC was determined by speech rate it would describe speech rate rather than rhythm. For this reason a variation coefficient (varcoDeltaC) will be calculated in order to monitor relative deltaC variation across speech rates. Results for varcoDeltaC support the views that a) according to varcoDeltaC rhythm classes seem to be better differentiable and b) some languages tend to vary in rhythm as a function of speech rate (German, English), while the rhythm of other languages seems to be unaffected by changes in speech rate (French).},

For each stretch of continuous speech obtained from the recordings, the normalized duration of consecutive syllables (except for the final-syllable) was compared, to derive a variability index (VI). It was found that there is a significantly greater variability in this measure of syllable-to-syllable duration for British English, which supports previous indications that, by comparison, Singapore English might indeed be regarded as being more syllable-timed. Additionally, it was found that there is little evidence of the influence of speaking rate on the measured differences in rhythm, but there is some evidence that the greater frequency of reduced syllables with a schwa in British English contributes to the difference between the two varieties.},

              Social meaning-based approaches to linguistic variation treat variation as a semiotic system, in which sociolinguistic signs\textemdash{}indexical links between linguistic forms and social meanings\textemdash{}serve as interactional resources that individuals use to project personae. This article explores the perceptual nature of the links between social personae and linguistic forms, examining how information about a speaker's persona can influence a listener's linguistic perceptions of a continuous phonetic feature. Using a phoneme categorization task, this study examines associations between gradient phonetic manifestations on a continuum from /\ae/ to /ɑ/ and three social personae. Findings illustrate that the social persona made relevant for a listener influences the ways in which points on this phonetic continuum are categorized phonemically as either
              trap
              or
              lot
              . Overall, this shows that the social constructs of personae influence phonetically detailed perceptions of linguistic material. (Sociolinguistic perception, personae, indexicality, sociophonetics, sociolinguistic signs)*},

  abstract = {This paper argues for a focus on the social meaning of variation, based in a study of stylistic practice. It is common in the study of variation to interpret variables as reflections of speakers' membership in social categories. Others have argued more recently that variables are associated not with the categories themselves, but with stances and characteristics that constitute those categories. The paper reviews some variation studies that show that variables do not have static meanings, but rather general meanings that become more specific in the context of styles. Building on Michael Silverstein's notion of indexical order, I argue that the meanings of variables are not precise or fixed but rather constitute a field of potential meanings \textendash{} an indexical field, or constellation of ideologically related meanings, any one of which can be activated in the situated use of the variable. The field is fluid, and each new activation has the potential to change the field by building on ideological connections. Thus variation constitutes an indexical system that embeds ideology in language and that is in turn part and parcel of the construction of ideology.},

migrants in Ypsilanti, Michigan has been affected by the emerging local norm,
an ongoing dialect change labeled the Northern Cities Shift (NCS). Recorded
speech from these migrants was acoustically analyzed to determine whether the
NCS feature of low-front vowel raising of

was present. Index scores derived from formant values were then subjected to
statistical analysis to determine the degree to which the respondents'
use of this vowel reflects participation in the NCS. The respondents'
use or nonuse of this feature was correlated with their sex, social status,
age, and social network characteristics to determine which, if any, have
influenced respondents' participation, or lack of participation,
in the NCS. The results show that social network and sex are
statistically significant predictors of acquisition, or lack of
acquisition, of the feature in question, whereas age and socioeconomic
status are not.This research is part of
a National Science Foundation Grant titled ``Accommodation in
Language Variation and Change.'' This research owes much to the

A hip\'otese que buscamos confirmar ou infirmar neste estudo \'e a de que as diferentes formas de express\~ao do foco informacional do sujeito realizadas em PB e PE, al\'em de estarem relacionadas a quest\~oes de natureza sint\'atica, como \`a fixa{\c c}\~ao do par\^ametro prodrop, como afirmam Nespor \& Guasti (2002) para as l\'inguas em geral, tamb\'em est\~ao relacionadas a quest\~oes de natureza pros\'odica, como, por exemplo, o peso fonol\'ogico dos constituintes nas senten{\c c}as. Os resultados alcan{\c c}ados nesta tese mostram que tanto em PE, como em PB, restri{\c c}\~oes de peso fonol\'ogico atuam na escolha por determinada forma de focaliza{\c c}\~ao informacional do sujeito. Todavia, ainda mostram que, em PE, requisitos fonol\'ogicos relacionados ao alinhamento da proemin\^encia do elemento focalizado com a proemin\^encia principal de senten{\c c}a podem tamb\'em ser satisfeitos atrav\'es do reordenamento de constituintes ou do uso de estruturas pseudoclivadas, por exemplo. Diferentemente do PE, o PB, dadas as particularidades de sua gram\'atica, n\~ao se vale destes mesmos artif\'icios. Em PB, ocorre preferencialmente o uso de senten{\c c}as na ordem SV(O) com o sujeito portando a proemin\^encia principal da senten{\c c}a ou o uso de senten{\c c}as clivadas e clivadas invertidas. Quanto \`a primeira estrat\'egia de focaliza{\c c}\~ao, ainda que o PE tamb\'em possa se utilizar dela, nossos resultados indicam que as duas variedades de portugu\^es apresentam diferen{\c c}as quanto \`a posi{\c c}\~ao sint\'atica ocupada pelo sujeito focalizado. Enquanto este elemento se encontra na posi{\c c}\~ao de especificador de TP em PE, em PB, ele se encontra fora de TP.

  abstract = {According to Abaurre \& Galves (1998) and Abaurre \& Fernandes-Svartman (2008), the secondary stress assignment essentially signals the beginning of the prosodic word ({$\omega$}) in emphatic contexts of Brazilian Portuguese (BP). This paper aims to confirm (or not) this affirmation, based on empirical analyses. For this task, we investigated the relation between the additional tones association and the secondary stress perception on {$\omega$}s produced in neutral and emphatic contexts by BP native speakers. Our results indicate that the BP secondary stress assignment can signal the beginning of the {$\omega$} or follow a binary pattern of rhythmic unities construction in both neutral and emphatic contexts of BP. Additional tones can also be found in these two discursive contexts, however we found these kind of tone more often associated with emphatic contexts.},

The tutorial is not intended as an introduction to experimental methodology or as an overview of the literature on the topic, but as an outline of observationally accessible aspects of fundamental frequency and timing patterns with the aid of computational visualisation, situated in a semiotic framework of sign ranks and interpretations. After an informal introduction to the basic concepts of prosody in the introduction and a discussion of the place of prosody in the architecture of language, a stylisation method for visualising aspects of prosody is introduced. Relevant acoustic phonetic topics in phonemic tone and accent prosody, word prosody, phrasal prosody and discourse prosody are then outlined, and a selection of specific cases taken from a number of typologically different languages is discussed: Anyi/Agni (Niger-Congo{$>$}Kwa, Ivory Coast), English, Kuki-Thadou (Sino-Tibetan, North-East India and Myanmar), Mandarin Chinese, Tem (NigerCongo{$>$}Gur, Togo) and Farsi. The main focus is on fundamental frequency patterns. Issues of timing and rhythm are discussed in the pre-final section. In the concluding section, further reading and possible future research directions, for example for the study of prosody in the evolution of speech, are outlined.},

Attempts to find correlates of different rhythm types in the acoustic signal have so far not been particularly successful. We examine a number of previous studies, in search of a promising measure of rhythm, and select a recently developed measure (the Pairwise Variability Index of Low \& Grabe), with minor modifications and the addition of a binary classifier for focal and nonfocal components of rhythm units. The measure and the classifier are implemented as a software tool which takes esps/waves+ label files as input, and generates statistics on durations, duration differences, the rhythm measure, and a classification of the syllables in the labeled utterance. The results show distinct differences in stress-timing and syllable-timing between Ibibio and English.},

Evaluation showed that the performances of this HTK-based aligner compare to human alignment and to other existing alignment tools. It was originally fully available for French, English.

By analyzing the phenomenon as a nonconcatenativeone, I claim that Hypocorization does not deletesound sequences of the base.

  abstract = {William Labov (b. 1927) is an American linguist who pioneered the study of variationist sociolinguistics. Born and raised in northern New Jersey, Labov studied English and philosophy at Harvard University (BA, 1948) and worked as an industrial chemist for several years before entering graduate school in linguistics at Columbia University in 1961. He completed his PhD in 1964, under the direction of Uriel Weinreich. He worked at Columbia until 1971, when he joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught until his retirement in 2014.
            Labov's influence on the field began with research he conducted in graduate school. His study of changing pronunciations on Martha's Vineyard, the subject of his master's thesis, introduced a method for observing sound change in progress and broke with tradition by exploring social motivations for linguistic innovations. For his PhD dissertation, Labov carried out a study of dialect patterns on the Lower East Side of New York City. Using a systematic, quantitative methodology, he demonstrated that linguistic variation is socially stratified, such that the use of pronunciation features (e.g., dropping of post-vocalic /r/) correlates with social class, ethnicity, etc. in regular patterns. Labov's early research was greatly influential and inspired many scholars to carry out similar projects in other communities. The paradigm came to be known as variationist sociolinguistics.
            Much of Labov's scholarship seeks to advance our understanding of language change. Historical linguists traditionally study completed linguistic changes, often long after they occurred, but Labov developed a method for examining active changes through a quantitative comparison of speakers representing several generations. This approach produces a new perspective on the change process by revealing intermediate stages. Labov has brought insights from this research to bear on theoretical debates within historical linguistics and the field more broadly. His work in this area has also documented many active sound changes in American English. Among these changes are innovations underway in particular dialects, such as the vowel changes in Philadelphia, as well as broader regional patterns, such as the Northern Cities Shift heard in the Great Lakes states.
            
              Throughout his career, social justice concerns have fueled Labov's research. He has sought to demonstrate that the speech of stigmatized groups is as systematic and rule-governed as any other. He led a pioneering study in Harlem in the late 1960s that shone new light on African American English, demonstrating, for example, that grammatical usages like the deletion of the copula (e.g.,

Frequently, it is treated as noise in the data and held to conceal what is really important about the prosodic structure of the language. Consequently, most investigations are restricted to a single standard variety and cross-speaker variation is ignored or masked by statistical processing. The results are often assumed to be representative of the language as a whole. Recent research challenges this approach. Acoustic correlates of rhythm class, for instance, show that dialects of one language can differ as much in their rhythmic structures as two different languages. One dialect can be classified as `stress-timed' and the other as `syllable-timed'. Furthermore, considerable cross-speaker variation occurs within dialects.},

Here, we investigate how objective rhythm measures develop during the acquisition of a second language. In a longitudinal study, nine native speakers of Spanish were recorded reading a text in English before and after a year of English language training at university level. A control group of nine native English speakers read the same text. Automatic forced alignment of speech segment boundaries using hidden Markov models allowed the calculation of C and V interval durations. Standard rhythm metrics (\%V, deltaC, deltaV, PVI) were calculated for all recordings. First results show that durational C interval characteristics between native English and Spanish English (pre- and post-training) do not differ. However, V interval characteristics (deltaV, nPVI, \%V) are lowest for English natives, higher for the Spanish post training group and highest for the Spanish pretraining group. The results suggest that (a) deficits of speech rhythm competence in a second language are mostly revealed on a vocalic level and (b) an increase in competence in a second language is reflected well by measurable speech rhythm.},

Real time data confirm this, showing that the form was almost nonexistent in this speech community two decades earlier. The social motivations of this innovation are examined in terms of local identity and the entry of new ethnic groups into the community, and possible linguistic sources are discussed.

The aim of the study is to shed light on the role that standard language ideologies play for loss of localised dialects. 

Varieties of East Norwegian spoken in the small city H\o{}nefoss and the capital city Oslo are becoming increasingly alike. Oslo speech is an influential factor in the loss in H\o{}nefoss of local linguistic variants in variables 3pl personal pronouns and . The force behind the regional dialect levelling is not the Oslo dialect only, however. Overt and covert attitudinal data show that the influence is twofold and that the codified written variety of Norwegian, Bokm\aa{}l, largely influences speakers' usage of local variants for linguistic variables stress in loanwords and plural definite article suffixes.

The investigation considers linguistic ideals that speakers link to codification of language (correctness), education or the capital city and attest that language that can be linked to all these ideals is becoming more widely used in the East Norway region. Speech that can be linked to the codified variety Bokm\aa{}l is an overt as well as a covert ideal to speakers in H\o{}nefoss. Covert positive attitudes towards speech from Oslo are also found.

This study shows that the social and political context of language must be taken into account in the study of loss of linguistic features. The social meaning of language is crucial in informing us about the social mechanisms behind dialect change.}

These processes are also occurring in the incoming language, Japanese. Second, these processes have influenced the acquisition of the prosody of Standard Japanese, resulting in a new prosodic system. Third, a positive attitude towards the local variant of Japanese is prevalent among the younger members of the community, particularly the working-class males.

This study is an initial attempt to examine the potential interactions between speaking condition (read speech vs. task-based dialogue) and social characteristics (speaker sex) on intonational variation. First, it is shown that 12 of the 16 speakers undergo at least one style-shift between speaking conditions; these data are captured in variationist terms, providing empirical assessments about formal and vernacular variants for the two sentence types in question. Second, it is shown that speaker sex differences play a role in style-shifting, and this leads to the hypothesis that variation in declarative questions may have developed as a marker of local identity for Manchego men. All in all, this study offers empirical support that the findings on sociophonetic variation warrant consideration in current models of speech production.},

The objective measures considered a wide range of distortions introduced by four types of real-world noise at two signal-to-noise ratio levels by four classes of speech enhancement algorithms: spectral subtractive, subspace, statistical-model based, and Wiener algorithms. The subjective quality ratings were obtained using the ITU-T P.835 methodology designed to evaluate the quality of enhanced speech along three dimensions: signal distortion, noise distortion, and overall quality. This paper reports on the evaluation of correlations of several objective measures with these three subjective rating scales. Several new composite objective measures are also proposed by combining the individual objective measures using nonparametric and parametric regression analysis techniques.},

  abstract = {Application of recently developed rhythmic measures to passages of read speech in colloquial and formal Tamil revealed some significant differences between the two varieties, which are in diglossic distribution. Both were also distinguished from a set of control data from British English speakers reading an equivalent passage. The findings have implications for the usefulness of the rhythmic measures and also the temporal characteristics of Tamil. High levels of interspeaker variability affected the measures; in some cases differences within each group of five speakers exceeded those separating distinct languages, indicating that such measures may not be reliable indicators of typological status. Discrepancies between previous findings and remeasurements of the same data also show the measures to be sensitive to differences in measurement criteria, specifically the treatment of pauses. The results confirm that the differences between colloquial and formal Tamil encompass durational characteristics, which appear to be largely explicable from differences in their syllabic structure. Provisional comparison with other languages suggests that their rhythmic properties cannot easily be captured by reference to traditional rhythmic classes. This may explain previous confusion in the literature over Tamil's temporal characteristics, which have been variously described in terms of stress-timing, syllable-timing, and mora-timing.},

A series of experiments measured listeners' sensitivity to frequencies in the form of variable percentages of the non-standard apical form of the variable (ING). Subjects heard ten trial readings of broadcast news from the same speaker, and rated them on a seven-point Likert scale of professional suitability. Responses conformed closely to a logarithmic function in which the effect of each deviation from the norm was proportional to the percent increase in deviations. The logarithmic pattern of responses was replicated in group and individual experiments in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in group experiments in Columbia, South Carolina and Durham, New Hampshire. South Carolina subjects were less critical of the /in/ variant in news broadcasting but showed the identical logarithmic function in reacting to Northern and Southern speakers. Inferences are drawn on the window of temporal resolution of the sociolinguistic monitor, its sensitivity and the pattern of attenuation over time.},

Among younger Philadelphians oriented to higher education, the traditional short-a system is giving way to the nasal system, in which all prenasal vowels are tense. We present evidence that this shift occurs systematically in both the lax and tense allophones. The degree of conformity to each system is measured for 106 subjects by the Pillai statistic; community-wide patterns are revealed by regression modeling and bimodality diagrams. Adherence to the traditional system is greatest for White speakers who graduated from Catholic high schools, while the nasal system is strongest for graduates from elite schools with special admission requirements. African American students show no orientation to the traditional system, but parallel White students in the shift to the nasal system. The histories of students through the educational system show that the speaker's short-a system is largely determined during their middle and high school years, before entering college. Special admission interviews play a special role in this process, as brief speech events that strongly determine the person's linguistic environment for the years that follow.},

The notion 'rule of grammar' is enlarged to include the formal treatment of inherent variation as a part of linguistic structure. Furthermore, a model is presented for the decisive solution of abstract questions of rule form and rule relations, based upon the direct study of linguistic behavior.},

  author = {Labov, William},
  date = {1978},
  abstract = {This paper is a response to Lavandera's question regarding the limits of the study of language variation. Sociolinguistics is characterized by its desire to limit representational meaning much more narrowly than formal linguistics. In addition while formal linguistics views language as species-specific and designed to accomodate logical representations, sociolinguistics views language in the context of common biological inheritance. The proper goal of sociolinguistic theory might be stated as the apportionment of the variance on any sub-section of a linguistic system to the functions of representation, identification, and accomodation, and to predict for any new language the probable distribution of information. Thus, variation studies go beyond grammatical description to  explanations of variable constraints which will lead to conclusions about the form of grammar. Although in its early days sociolinguistic analysis developed to study sociolinguistic stratification, the full value of variation analysis has only gradually become clear. In addition to its usefulness in describing phonological variation, variation analysis can be a tool in the description of syntactic and semantic analysis, and variation theory as a whole can be a heuristic device for determining the shape of linguistic theory.

  abstract = {Two general principles of sexual differentiation emerge from previous sociolinguistic studies: that men use a higher frequency of nonstandard forms than women in stable situations, and that women are generally the innovators in linguistic change. It is not clear whether these two tendencies can be unified, or how differences between the sexes can account for the observed patterns of linguistic change. The extensive interaction between sex and other social factors raises the issue as to whether the curvilinear social class pattern associated with linguistic change is the product of a rejection of female-dominated changes by lower-class males. Multivariate analysis of data from the Philadelphia Project on Linguistic Change and Variation indicates that sexual differentiation is independent of social class at the beginning of a change, but that interaction develops gradually as social awareness of the change increases. It is proposed that sexual differentiation of language is generated by two distinct processes: (1) for all social classes, the asymmetric context of language learning leads to an initial acceleration of female-dominated changes and retardation of male-dominated changes; (2) women lead men in the rejection of linguistic changes as they are recognized by the speech community, a differentiation that is maximal for the second highest status group.},

  abstract = {DD NOTE: Preliminary plans for the second edition involve new chapters on tone, on diphthongs, and critical updates to the IPA and the literature. More revision plans will be forthcoming.  This book gives a description of all the known ways in which the sounds of the world's languages differ. In doing so, it provides the empirical foundations for linguistic phonetics and phonology. Encapsulating the work of two leading figures in the field, it will be a standard work of reference for researchers in phonetics and linguistics for many years to come.  The scope of the book is truly global, with data drawn from nearly 400 languages, many of them investigated at first hand by the authors. A picture of the full range of possible contrasting phonetic categories is created by comparing families of similar sounds across many different languages.  Separate chapters deal with place of articulation, stops, nasals, fricatives, laterals, rhotics, clicks, vowels, and segments with multiple articulations. Each chapter is packed with illustrations documenting the articulatory and acoustic characteristics of the sounds discussed, and serving to illustrate the application of modern experimental techniques to descriptive phonetic studies. Praise for the first edition:  "Scholarly account which frequently challenges many of the traditional concepts in phonetic and linguistic theory." W. J. Hardcastle, Queen Margaret College " It is a boon to all teachers and researchers in the field." W. Barry, Universitat des Saarlandes, Saarbrucken, Germany  "It is the most comprehensive treatment to date and a book all students of phonology and phonetics will want to own." Michael Kenstowicz, MIT  "It is well written, superbly researched and it will make a mark in the halls of linguistics publishing. It is a book a vast range of linguists, phoneticians, speech scientists and others will need to have on their shelves." John A Goldsmith, University of Chicago  "An instant standard reference work that belongs on the desk of every linguist who has interest in what sounds human languages make use of." Geoffrey S.

Moreover, the `why' question can also be read as `what for'. What does anyone say anything for? I think we can safely say that this question places sociolinguistic analysis in a functional framework.

For this reason, voice quality is of interest to a wide range of disciplines, including linguistics, phonetics and speech science, speech pathology, sociology, psychology, medicine, and communication engineering. Literature on voice quality is, consequently, scattered through a correspondingly wide range of publications. While this bibliography is unlikely to be exhaustive, it aims to be comprehensive. Exceptions to this are purely medical literature and literature on speech pathology; also, although a number of different languages are represented, works in English received the principal coverage.},

In a between-subjects design using three conditions, we tested 62 listeners (Zurich Swiss German) in a two-alternative-forced choice dialect identification experiment: in condition one, 21 listeners were asked to identify two dialects (Valais and Bern Swiss German) in unmorphed form. In condition two, 20 different listeners had to identify the same two dialects but with swapped speech rhythm, and in condition three, 21 different listeners had to identify the same dialects with swapped speech rhythm and intonation. The experiment showed that exchanging speech rhythm alone or speech rhythm combined with intonation had very little effect on the listeners' dialect identification performance: listeners appear to use primarily segmental information in the identification process. Further results revealed that (a) superimposing the prosodic structure of one dialect (Bern Swiss German) onto another (Valais Swiss German) caused greater variability across some listeners than the other way around and that (b) identification performance varies as a function of sentence material used, i.e. how the sentences differ in segmental and prosodic make-up. We discuss implications for forensic phonetics, language and cognition, and automatic speech recognition.},

            This article examines how social stereotypes influence listeners' perceptions of indexical language. Building on recent developments in linguistics and social psychology, I investigate the extent to which stereotypical attitudes and beliefs about categories of speakers serve to enable the association of linguistic features with particular social meanings while simultaneously blocking others. My arguments are based on an analysis of listener perceptions of the intersecting categories of gender, sexuality, and social class among men in the UK. Using a modified matched-guise paradigm to test three category-relevant variables (mean pitch, spectral characteristics of /s/, and TH-fronting), I demonstrate how the perception of social meaning is governed by a combination of both attitudinal and cognitive factors. This finding is important because it illustrates the listener-dependent nature of sociolinguistic perception. Moreover, it also provides further empirical support for an understanding of social meaning as an emergent property of language-in-use.

The technique is based on a phone recognition system based on a trigram phonotactic model, gamma distribution phone duration models, and a spectral model based on five different structures for phone models of varying contextual dependencies. The alignment of speech with a given phone sequence is performed as a very constrained phone recognition task with the phonotactic model based only on the given phone sequence. When only orthographic transcription is provided, a classification-tree-based prediction of most likely phone realizations is used as an input network for the phone recognizer. The maximum likelihood phone sequence is then treated as the true phone sequence and its segment boundaries are compared with the reference boundaries.{$<>$}},

Este programa adota como pressuposto fundamental a representa{\c c}\~ao fonol\'ogica de par\^ametros ac\'usticos cont\'inuos, preservada pela a{\c c}\~ao de primitivos mel\'odicos como o alvo/tom a ser atingido, o registro funcional dos tons e o alinhamento abstrato entre curva entoacional e material ling\"u\'istico. O emprego de tal sistema para a nota{\c c}\~ao de um corpus de fala espont\^anea do PB, em substitui{\c c}\~ao a um corpus de fala semi-espont\^anea, se mostrou pouco produtivo e apontou para a necessidade de um sistema que combinasse aspectos formais e funcionais em sua descri{\c c}\~ao.

The study of these relationships were based on Barbosa's (2006) Dynamic Model of Speech Rhythm; on Dato intonational annotation system proposed by Lucente (2008); and on the Computational Model of the Structure of Discourse, proposed by Grosz \& Sidner (1986). The Dynamic Model of Rhythm suggests that the speech rhythm is the result of the action of two oscillators \textendash{} accentual and syllabic - which receive as input linguistic and gestural information, and give the output as gestural duration. Thisarticle hypothesis is that in addition to these oscillators, a glottal oscillator can act controlling the intonation patterns of speech. These patterns, or intonational cycles, which organize the BP intonation, emerge when related to the spontaneous discourse segmentation. For each discourse segment classified as spontaneous according to a criteria proposed in this article, the speech issegmented into the DaTo system in linguistically structured units, which contains the purposes of communication and attention. Each of these segments is aligned to the speech intonation pattern delimitated by a rising contour (LH or{$>$} HL) at the beginning and by a falling contour (LHL), or a boundary level (L), at the end. The speech rhythm is also aligned to the pattern formed between intonation and discourse. By the inclusion of a new layer for the stress groups segmentation into DaTo system was possible to observe that the alignment between the stress groups segmentation and the intonational annotation coincide with discourse segments boundaries. The alignment between intonation, rhythm and discourse, having the stress groups as attractors, allowed us to propose the insertion of a glottal oscillator into the Dynamic Model of Rhythm.},

Questions of the frequency and co-occurrence of the particular segment types are discussed in detail and possible explanations for the patterns observed are evaluated.

It is based on the use of a speech synthesizer for the alignment of a text on its corresponding speech signal. A high-quality digital speech synthesizer is used to create a synthetic reference speech pattern used in the alignment process. This approach has the great advantage on other approaches that no training stage (hence no labeled database) is needed. The system has been mainly evaluated on French read utterances. Other evaluations have been made on other languages like English, German, Romanian and Spanish. Following these experiments, the system seems to be a powerful tool for the automatic constitution of large phonetically and prosodically labeled speech databases. The availability of such corpora will be a key point for the development of improved speech synthesis and recognition systems.},

  abstract = {The study of sociolinguistics constitutes a vast and complex topic that has yielded an extensive and multifaceted body of scholarship. Language is fundamentally at work in how we operate as individuals, as members of various communities, and within cultures and societies. As speakers, we learn not only the structure of a given language; we also learn cultural and social norms about how to use language and what content to communicate. We use language to navigate expectations, to engage in interpersonal interaction, and to go along with or to speak out against social structures and systems.
            
              Sociolinguistics aims to study the effects of language use within and upon societies and the reciprocal effects of social organization and social contexts on language use. In contemporary theoretical perspectives, sociolinguists view language and society as being
              mutually constitutive
              : each influences the other in ways that are inseparable and complex. Language is imbued with and carries social, cultural, and personal meaning. Through the use of linguistic markers, speakers symbolically define self and society. Simply put, language is not merely content; rather, it is something that we
              do
              , and it affects how we act and interact as social beings in the world.
            
            Language is a social product with rich variation along individual, community, cultural, and societal lines. For this reason, context matters in sociolinguistic research. Social categories such as gender, race/ethnicity, social class, nationality, etc., are socially constructed, with considerable variation within and among categories. Attributes such as ``female'' or ``upper class'' do not have universal effects on linguistic behavior, and sociolinguists cannot assume that the most interesting linguistic differences will be between groups of speakers in any simple, binary fashion. Sociolinguistic research thus aims to explore social and linguistic diversity in order to better understand how we, as speakers, use language to inhabit and negotiate our many personal, cultural, and social identities and roles.},

This finding is supported by an acoustic experiment which showed that the standard deviation of VV duration and/or SG duration is smaller at fast rates. In addition, this work reveal that the decrease of standard deviation of SG and/or VV duration is influenced by many factors such as dialect, gender, and sentence structure.

  abstract = {"The most comprehensive overview available, this handbook is an essential guide to sociolinguistics today. Reflecting the breadth of research in the field, it surveys a range of topics and approaches in the study of language variation and use in society. As well as linguistic perspectives, the handbook includes insights from anthropology, social psychology, the study of discourse and power, conversation analysis, theories of style and styling, language contact and applied sociolinguistics. Language practices seem to have reached new levels since the communications revolution of the late twentieth century. At the same time face-to-face communication is still the main force of language identity, even if social and peer networks of the traditional face-to-face nature are facing stiff competition of the Facebook-to-Facebook sort. The most authoritative guide to the state of the field, this handbook shows that sociolinguistics provides us with the best tools for understanding our unfolding evolution as social beings."--Publisher's website},

The Pairwise Variability Index (PVI) was used to measure the mean variation in duration, intensity, and pitch of successive vowels in the speech of over 500 New Zealanders, born between 1851 and 1988. Normalized vocalic PVIs for duration have reduced over time, after allowing for changes in speech rate, supporting existing findings that stressed and unstressed vowels are less differentiated by duration in modern NZE than in other varieties of English. Rhythmically, syllable duration may be playing a reduced role in signalling prominence in NZE. This is supported by the finding that there have been contemporaneous changes in pitch and intensity variation. We discuss external and internal influences on the timing of NZE, including contact with M\=aori, the emergence of M\=aori English, and diachronic vowel shift.},

  abstract = {Is speech rhythmic? In the absence of evidence for a traditional view that languages strive to coordinate either syllables or stress-feet with regular time intervals, we consider the alternative that languages exhibit contrastive rhythm subsisting merely in the alternation of stronger and weaker elements. This is initially plausible, particularly for languages with a steep `prominence gradient', i.e. a large disparity between stronger and weaker elements; but we point out that alternation is poorly achieved even by a `stress-timed' language such as English, and, historically, languages have conspicuously failed to adopt simple phonological remedies that would ensure alternation. Languages seem more concerned to allow `syntagmatic contrast' between successive units and to use durational effects to support linguistic functions than to facilitate rhythm. Furthermore, some languages (e.g. Tamil, Korean) lack the lexical prominence which would most straightforwardly underpin prominence of alternation. We conclude that speech is not incontestibly rhythmic, and may even be antirhythmic. However, its linguistic structure and patterning allow the metaphorical extension of rhythm in varying degrees and in different ways depending on the language, and it is this analogical process which allows speech to be matched to external rhythms.},

The speakers show remarkable first dialect stability with respect to their low back vowel system, even after many years of new dialect exposure: in minimal pair contexts, nearly all of the speakers continue to produce and perceive a single vowel category. However, in word list and conversational contexts, the majority of speakers exhibit a small but significant phonetic difference between words like
              cot
              and
              caught
              , reflecting the separation of these word classes in the new dialect to which they are exposed; moreover, the realization of these words shows frequency effects consistent with a lexically gradual divergence of the two vowels.

Final rises are fairly common, occurring approximately twice a minute, predominantly on declaratives and in narrative sequences. We briefly consider the interplay between voice quality (known to be a marker of transition relevance) and rising intonation in Finnish. We argue that in narrative sequences, rising terminals manage two main interactional tasks: they provide a place for a coparticipant to mark recipiency, and they project more talk by the current speaker. Using a methodology which combines phonetic observation with conversation analysis, we demonstrate participants' orientation to these functions.},

We focus on the perspective of structural cohesion, and show that co-variability is conditioned not only by structural similarities among dependent variables (such as agreement processes or coda weakening), but also by general linguistic constraints that operate across multiple variables, such as phonic salience (Naro 1981, Scherre 1988, Naro et al. 1999). Finally, we suggest that markedness may be a more general linguistic principle underlying co-variation.}

A distribui{\c c}\~ao geral dos dados indica que a atual taxa de retroflexo \'e de aproximadamente 33\% na fala de paulistanos nascidos e criados na cidade. Linguisticamente, os resultados apontam para o favorecimento da variante retroflexa em contextos em que o (-r) \'e precedido por vogal [-alta], seguido de consoante [coronal], em verbos, em s\'ilabas t\^onicas e em final de palavra; socialmente, o retroflexo \'e favorecido entre moradores de regi\~oes mais perif\'ericas, com menor mobilidade geogr\'afica, menos escolarizados, do sexo masculino e pertencentes a fam\'ilias menos enraizadas na cidade de S\~ao Paulo. O construto ``tempo aparente'' (LABOV, 2001a) sugere poss\'ivel mudan{\c c}a em progresso em favor do retroflexo, mas h\'a ind\'icios de movimentos divergentes dentro da comunidade.

Este trabalho analisa a varia{\c c}\~ao entreo quatro estruturas de Interrogativas-Q em amostras de fala e de escrita do portugu\^es paulistano contempor\^aneo: (i) interrogativas-qu (Onde voc\^e mora?); (ii) interrogativas qu-que (Onde que voc\^e mora?); (iii)interrogativas \'e que (Onde \'e que voc\^e mora?); e (iv) interrogativas qu-in-situ (Voc\^e mora onde?). A equival\^encia sem\^antica entre as formas interrogativas se estabelece atrav\'es do conceito de pressuposi{\c c}\~ao do falante (Stalnaker, 2002). Al\'em disso, este trabalho prop\~oe o conceito de compet\^encia comunicativa (Hymes, 1991[1979]) como crit\'erio para determinar o envelope de varia{\c c}\~ao: diferentes estruturas s\~ao consideradas variantes se forem factualmente poss\'iveis, fact\'iveis, adequadas e empregadas nos mesmos contextos. A an\'alise qualitativa com base nesses conceitos define dois envelopes de varia{\c c}\~ao-e, portanto, duas vari\'aveis: uma que envolve a altern\^ancia na posi{\c c}\~ao do constituinte interrogativo (in situ ou n\~ao), e outra que encerra as tr\^es estruturas com constituinte interrogativo pr\'e-verbal (-qu, qu-que e \'e-que). Os resultados das an\'alises quantitativas mostram que interrogativas qu-in-situ s\~ao favorecidas principalmente por fatores morfossint\'aticos e discursivo-pragam\'aticos; fatores extralingu\'isticos, como sexo/gen\^ero e a faixa et\'aria do falante , tamb\'em se correlacionam indiretamente atrav\'es do emprego de diferentes discursivas. O uso de interrogativas qu-que, por sua vez, demonstra uma prov\'avel mudan{\c c}a lingu\'istica em progresso, uma vez que a an\'alise em tempo aparente revela o favorecimento da estrutura por falantes mais jovens. Neste caso, a varia{\c c}\~ao \'e influenciada principalmente por fatores sint\'aticos e pros\'odicos. Al\'em de propor crit\'erios para o estudo de vari\'aveis morfossint\'aticas, este trabalho discute os resultados das an\'alises quantitativas em perspectiva com outros n\'iveis de varia{\c c}\~ao lingu\'istica, com vistas a integra-los em um quadro mais amplo da Teoria da Varia{\c c}\~ao.},

  abstract = {The question of the simultaneous embedding of multiple sociolinguistic variables in a community is rarely addressed in studies of language variation and change. Based on a corpus of 118 recordings with Paulistano speakers, this article discusses co-variation among three variables of Brazilian Portuguese: nominal agreement, 3PP verb agreement, and 1PP verb agreement. The main goal is to analyze whether speakers who tend to use the nonstandard variant of a variable also tend to employ other nonstandard variants of the other two variables, or if they are independently embedded in the social and linguistic system. Each speaker's weight for each variable was analyzed through Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs of variables (NP-3PP, NP-1PP, and 3PP-1PP). The results show that co-variation between NP and 3PP is stronger than that between the verb agreement variables 3PP and 1PP. We suggest that co-variation depends not only on structural similarities, but also on social cohesion and on internal factors correlated with multiple variables, such as phonic salience.},

O objetivo central \'e analisar, em uma comunidade amplamente heterog\^enea de um ponto de vista sociodemogr\'afico, as inter-rela{\c c}\~oes entre a express\~ao de identidades sociais atrav\'es de usos lingu\'isticos e a poss\'ivel influ\^encia dos significados sociais desses usos em processos de varia{\c c}\~ao e mudan{\c c}a lingu\'istica. Para tanto, analisou-se qualitativa e quantitativamente uma amostra contempor\^anea do portugu\^es paulistano, composta de 118 entrevistas sociolingu\'isticas com falantes nativos, \`a luz dos pressupostos te\'orico-metodol\'ogicos da Sociolingu\'istica Variacionista (Labov, 2006 [1966], 2008 [1972]). Tais an\'alises compreendem o encaixamento lingu\'istico e social de cada vari\'avel, bem como seu encaixamento simult\^aneo na fala de cada indiv\'iduo. Al\'em disso, examinaram-se percep{\c c}\~oes sobre as variantes de (-r), com base na t\'ecnica de est\'imulos pareados (Lambert et al., 1960), a fim de melhor compreender os mecanismos subjacentes \`a associa{\c c}\~ao de certos significados sociais ao emprego de diferentes formas lingu\'isticas. Os resultados mostram que, embora as correla{\c c}\~oes entre as quatro vari\'aveis sociolingu\'isticas e vari\'aveis sociais sejam bastante semelhantes entre si (todas se correlacionam com o Sexo/G\^enero, a Classe Social e o N\'ivel de Escolaridade dos falantes), h\'a diferentes tend\^encias dentro da comunidade por exemplo, mudan{\c c}a em dire{\c c}\~ao \`a variante ditongada [ej]; padr\~oes divergentes quanto ao emprego de (-r) por parte de jovens de diferentes classes sociais; varia{\c c}\~ao est\'avel das concord\^ancias nominal e verbal em regi\~oes perif\'ericas e mudan{\c c}a em dire{\c c}\~ao \`a variante padr\~ao em regi\~oes centrais. Para compreend\^e-los, o exame de seus significados sociais \'e fundamental. Argumenta-se que [ej] tem se difundido r\'apida e unidirecionalmente pelo fato de se constituir um marcador (Labov, 2008 [1972]) para paulistanos, que n\~ao revelam ter consci\^encia da vari\'avel, tampouco apresentam um discurso metalingu\'istico sobre suas variantes. O forte favorecimento do retroflexo entre jovens de classes baixas foi desencadeado por uma reinterpreta{\c c}\~ao de seu significado social como uma variante local e de prest\'igio, devido \`a presen{\c c}a maci{\c c}a de migrantes do Norte/Nordeste, cuja variante fricativa \'e relativamente mais estigmatizada na comunidade. Ao mesmo tempo, ainda que o encaixamento social das concord\^ancias nominal e verbal seja bastante semelhante, a marca zero de concord\^ancia nominal (as casa) goza de maior vitalidade por indexicalizar significados como masculinidade, paulistanidade e morador da Mooca. N\~ao obstante as diferentes tend\^encias que se verificam na comunidade, os padr\~oes de encaixamento das vari\'aveis lingu\'isticas se reproduzem sistematicamente na fala de cada indiv\'iduo, o que permite caracterizar os paulistanos como uma \'unica comunidade de fala (Labov, 2006 [1966]), que compartilha normas de produ{\c c}\~ao e de avalia{\c c}\~ao lingu\'istica. De acordo com o teste de percep{\c c}\~oes, os moradores da cidade tamb\'em s\~ao consistentes em suas rea{\c c}\~oes subjetivas a variantes de (-r). Demonstra-se adicionalmente que a coes\~ao dialetal \'e promovida n\~ao por amplas categorias sociais como Sexo/G\^enero ou Faixas Et\'arias, mas pelo princ\'ipio mais fundamental de densidade de comunica{\c c}\~ao (Gumperz, 1971b,a).},

The qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest that the zero morpheme variant indexes masculinity in male Paulistanos' speech, as well as local identities.Keywords: Nominal number agreement, Paulistano Portuguese, Social Identities.},

The main objective is to assess which social and linguistic factors promote the co-occurrence of different language variants in speakers' speech. The results show that co-variation can occur both between structurally related variables (e.g. the syntactic variables) and structurally unrelated ones (e.g. /r/-retroflexion and nominal agreement), as well as between variables of different domains (phonological and syntactic variables). We argue that, socially, lectal cohesion is a result of greater density of communication among peers than with out-group speakers, as shown by a higher degree of lectal cohesion among less mobile speakers, living in central areas, and whose parents were also born in the community. Linguistically, independent variables such as phonic salience (which has been demonstrated to correlate with multiple sociolinguistic variables) underlie patterns of co-variation more generally, as less salient variants tend to co-occur more often than more salient ones.},

The first part of the paper provides a review of some main topics concerning the object of our study: prosodic stereotypes in cultural groups, the role of the larger context in speech analysis, and the relationship between intonational variations and group cultural norms. The second part of the paper focuses on the intonation of African-American Vernacular English. After an examination of the sparse research on the subject, an experiment reveals several intonational characteristics of the group which are reported to communicate sense of community, playfulness, and creativity. The importance of such behaviors in that speech community is supported by historical reports and recent observations. They are described as (1) originating from Africa and from the socio-economic changes the group has faced during its short history, and (2) serving to the expression of affirmation of black identity. This analysis confirms the need of a multifunctional approach in speech analysis which would include the larger context, particularly in prosody where these notions have rarely been considered.},

  abstract = {Resumo: Para algumas teorias da percep{\c c}\~ao da fala, esse processo pode ocorrer pela a{\c c}\~ao da audi{\c c}\~ao (Teoria Qu\^antica), da vis\~ao (Teoria Motora) ou, ainda, pela a{\c c}\~ao conjugada da audi{\c c}\~ao e da vis\~ao (efeito McGurck). Para que o processo de percep{\c c}\~ao seja completo, \'e requerida a decodifica{\c c}\~ao da mensagem contida no percepto, que pode ocorrer a partir de um acesso top-down (descendente) ou bottom-up (ascendente) \`as informa{\c c}\~oes dos diferentes n\'iveis. Considerando que a percep{\c c}\~ao da fala conta com informa{\c c}\~oes visuais, a presente tese busca investigar a a{\c c}\~ao dos est\'imulos auditivo e visual na percep{\c c}\~ao de recursos gr\'aficos, ou marcadores pros\'odicos, usados na escrita do Portugu\^es Brasileiro com a fun{\c c}\~ao de representar graficamente varia{\c c}\~oes pros\'odicas. Dentre os diferentes tipos de marcadores descritos na literatura, foram objetos de investiga{\c c}\~ao desta pesquisa aqueles que s\~ao palavras escritas e cuja carga sem\^antica indica varia{\c c}\~oes pros\'odicas, sendo, portanto, Marcadores Pros\'odicos Lexicais (MPL), e aqueles que s\~ao marcas gr\'aficas, Marcadores Pros\'odicos Gr\'aficos (MPG), em particular, os sinais de pontua{\c c}\~ao, cujo sentido convencionado tem o mesmo efeito da carga sem\^antica dos MPLs. Os MPLs s\~ao recursos gr\'aficos usados para indicar, na escrita, atitudes do falante, enquanto os MPGs tendem a indicar varia{\c c}\~oes pros\'odicas mais diretamente relacionadas ao processo dial\'ogico. Considerando que esses recursos gr\'aficos possuem uma realidade visual e uma realidade auditiva, objetivou investigar a a{\c c}\~ao dos est\'imulos auditivo e visual na percep{\c c}\~ao desses marcadores. Para tanto, foi delineado um design experimental, no qual foram controladas as frases-alvo sob escopo dos marcadores: MPLs: gritar, dizere baixo, berrar, sussurar, dizer r\'apido e dizer devagar; MPGs: : ! ? . \textquestiondown{} ,; bem como foram controlados os contextos em que essas frases apareceriam. Foram gravadas as leituras em voz alta dos textos com as frases-alvo. Para controle da a{\c c}\~ao dos est\'imulos auditivo e visual, foram consideradas 6 condi{\c c}\~oes experimentais: 2 condi{\c c}\~oes mono modais auditiva e visual; 4 bimodais: 1 com coincid\^encia entre as informa{\c c}\~oes auditivas e visuais; 1 com est\'imulo auditivo sem varia{\c c}\~ao mel\'odica e 2 em condi{\c c}\~ao de mismatch, desencontro das informa{\c c}\~oes dos est\'imulos auditivo e visual). Nas condi{\c c}\~oes bimodais, os est\'imulos auditivo e visual foram apresentados simultaneamente de forma sincronizada. O teste de percep{\c c}\~ao foi aplicado com cada informante, a quem foi solicitado a informar em voz alta, atrav\'es de um n\'umero espec\'ifico, o marcador pros\'odico que tinha observado. Foi medido o tempo de reposta de execu{\c c}\~ao dessas tarefas. A partir das repostas dadas pelos informantes, foram obtidas as vari\'aveis porcentagem de escolha do marcador presente no est\'imulo auditivo e de escolha do marcador presente no est\'imulo visual e porcentagem de escolha do marcador diferente daqueles presentes nos dois est\'imulos. A vari\'avel velocidade de leitura foi obtida para cada informante.Os dados foram submetidos a testes estat\'isticos de normalidade, compara{\c c}\~ao de m\'edias e reamostragem. Os resultados obtidos evidenciam participa{\c c}\~ao diferenciada dos est\'imulos auditivo e visual na percep{\c c}\~ao dos MPLs e dos MPGs.

  abstract = {A neglected aspect of intonation research has been the nature and extent of variability in the use of prosodic features within a speech community.Crossspeaker variability in intonation was investigated through analysis of data collected from 90 adult speakers of English from London, England, using a new prosodic test battery (PEPS). PEPS is designed to elicit information about how speakers use prosodic features to realize different types of linguistic and communicative function in their own speech, and also how they perceive and interpret these features. Although there were no significant effects of gender or age in isolation on prosodic performance, there was a small effect of educational level among younger adults. Despite this group homogeneity,qualitative analysis of data from two of the production tasks showed considerable variation across participants in their use of prosodic features,suggesting that speakers'realization of communicative functions through prosody is more variable than has hither to been assumed.},

  abstract = {Este estudo trata da varia{\c c}\~ao regional em portugu\^es brasileiro, pautando-se pelo vi\'es perceptivo dos estudos da linguagem. Os trabalhos perceptuais de Atkinsons (1968), Bonte (1975), Maidment (1976), Ohala e Gilbert (1978) e Bezooijen e Gooskens (1999) j\'a apontaram para a import\^ancia da pros\'odia como pista no reconhecimento das l\'inguas e suas variedades regionais. Dessa maneira, este trabalho tem como objetivo verificar se os informantes de portugu\^es brasileiro s\~ao capazes de reconhecer suas pr\'oprias variedades regionais apenas pela pros\'odia, al\'em de buscar, por meio de uma an\'alise de produ{\c c}\~ao, pistas nas varia{\c c}\~oes de F0 que possam justificar o reconhecimento dessas variedades. Trata-se de um estudo experimental sobre 3 variedades do portugu\^es brasileiro: variedade de Pelotas (RS), a de S\~ao Paulo (bairro da Mooca) e a de Senador Pompeu (CE). Um teste perceptual foi elaborado de maneira a eliminar do sinal ac\'ustico os segmentos produzidos (experimento 1), deixando como informa{\c c}\~ao para os participantes somente as caracter\'isticas pros\'odicas. Esse experimento foi subdividido em trechos de fala curtos e longos, e, para a feitura com fala delexicalizada, foi utilizado o script PURR (SONNTAG; PORTELE, 1998b). Em contrapartida, o experimento 2 eliminou as varia{\c c}\~oes pros\'odicas, restando somente a curva mel\'odica monot\^onica (CMM) e os segmentos. A monotoniza{\c c}\~ao dos trechos de fala foi feita por meio de uma senoide com o valor do tom m\'edio de cada est\'imulo, obtido automaticamente via aplicativo ExProsodia (FERREIRA NETTO, 2010). A an\'alise dos dados foi feita de duas maneiras: via Teoria da Detec{\c c}\~ao TD (MACMILLAN; CREELMAN, 2005) e an\'alise estat\'istica dos dados. Os 9 resultados obtidos na TD demonstraram que os participantes tiveram um bom desempenho na tarefa de reconhecimento de suas variedades, com \'indices dprime elevados (d {$>$} 0). O desempenho entre o experimento 1 e 2 foi diverso, apresentando uma maior dificuldade de reconhecimento no experimento 1 com est\'imulos delexicalizados (PURR). Os informantes tiveram um desempenho melhor no experimento 2 (75\% de acertos contra 62\% do experimento 1). O mesmo foi observado por Bezooijen e Gooskens (1999), em estudo sobre percep{\c c}\~ao de caracter\'isticas dialetais do ingl\^es e do holand\^es. Na an\'alise estat\'istica dos dados, no experimento 1 (PURR), os informantes da variedade de S\~ao Paulo tiveram um desempenho diverso dos demais. Da mesma forma, na an\'alise de produ{\c c}\~ao, os est\'imulos da variedade de S\~ao Paulo apresentaram diferen{\c c}as significativas no tom m\'edio e na dispers\~ao de F0. A tend\^encia dos alarmes falsos (TD) tamb\'em corroborou a hip\'otese de que os ouvintes s\~ao capazes de reconhecer sua pr\'opria variedade por meio da pros\'odia.},

            It is well documented that the same sociolinguistic feature can be used as a sociolinguistic resource with different indexical potentials in different linguistic as well as social contexts. Often, however, indexical meanings of a specific feature are related to or derived from one another. In this article we present the results of a perceptual study of indexical meanings of alveolar versus fronted (s)\textemdash{}[s] versus [s+]\textemdash{}in different registers. The data consist of responses to male speakers' use of [s] and [s+] respectively, in two different registers that may be labelled ``modern Copenhagen speech'' and ``street language.'' Results show that the [s+] indexes femininity and gayness when it occurs in ``modern Copenhagen,'' whereas the (s)-variation has a different and less significant effect when occurring in ``street language.'' We discuss the implications for theories of indexical fields and the relation between features and clusters of features in speakers' perceptions. (Indexical meaning, phonetic variation, fronted /s/, perception of sexual orientation and ethnicity, matched guise technique).},

Results show that the palatalized /t/ affects the indexicality of fronted /s/ with respect to perceived femininity and gayness when it occurs in ``modern Copenhagen,'' where fronted /s/ has previously been shown to index these traits. However, the variation has a different and less significant effect when occurring in ``street language.'' Furthermore, the effect is only found in ``modern Copenhagen'' if the speaker has not previously been heard to produce a fronted /s/. We discuss the implications for theories of the relation between features and clusters of features in listeners' perceptions.},

            Previous studies on released /t/ collectively suggest that the linguistic feature is associated with intelligence and education, social meanings that can be recruited in constructing articulate personas. This study examines the production of released /t/ by six prominent U.S. political figures, as well as the social meanings listeners attribute to the variant. Employing a matched guise technique facilitated by digital stimulus manipulation, we find that the social meanings associated with released /t/ are constrained by linguistic and social factors. Regarding the former, word-medial /t/ releases carry stronger social meanings than those appearing word-finally. With respect to social factors, listener interpretations vary according to the identity of the speaker and knowledge of how frequently particular speakers produce /t/ releases. Thus, even though conventionalized associations between linguistic forms and meanings can be drawn upon to construct articulate personas, not all speakers can do so with equal effectiveness.},

Focusing on the speech of Heath, a speaker exhibiting considerable cross-situational variation, I show that when attending a barbecue with friends, Heath's falsetto is more frequent, longer, and characterized by higher fundamental frequency (f0) levels and wider f0 ranges. Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations. This meaning is employed to construct a `diva' persona and may also participate in building a gay identity.},

Although researchers have measured many speech signal properties, they have failed to identify reliable acoustic characteristics for language classes. This paper presents instrumental measurements based on a consonant/vowel segmentation for eight languages. The measurements suggest that intuitive rhythm types reflect specific phonological properties, which in turn are signaled by the acoustic/phonetic properties of speech. The data support the notion of rhythm classes and also allow the simulation of infant language discrimination, consistent with the hypothesis that newborns rely on a coarse segmentation of speech. A hypothesis is proposed regarding the role of rhythm perception in language acquisition.},

The workshop brought together lead ing researchers in the fields of speech and signal processing, electrical en gineering, psychology, and linguistics, to discuss aspects of spontaneous speech prosody and to suggest approaches to its computational analysis and modelling. The book is divided into four sections. Part I gives an overview and theoretical background to the nature of spontaneous speech, differentiating it from the lab-speech that has been the focus of so many earlier analyses. Part II focuses on the prosodic features of discourse and the structure of the spoken message, Part ilIon the generation and modelling of prosody for computer speech synthesis. Part IV discusses how prosodic information can be used in the context of automatic speech recognition. Each section of the book starts with an invited overview paper to situate the chapters in the context of current research. We feel that this collection of papers offers interesting insights into the scope and nature of the problems concerned with the computational analysis and modelling of real spontaneous speech, and expect that these works will not only form the basis of further developments in each field but also merge to form an integrated computational model of prosody for a better understanding of human processing of the complex interactions of the speech chain.},

ABSTRACT  This paper discusses syllable duration with respect to different prosodic domains and presents additional tools to analyze syntactic structures through phonological cues. Our results show that post-tonic syllables are longer at the intonational phrase boundary but not at other prosodic boundaries. The results also show that the type of vowel involved does not affect the duration of the syllable, but consonant voicing does. Finally, we show that both real words and logatoms do not affect the results.    KEYWORDS   Prosodic Domains. Duration. Syntax-Phonology Interface.},

Due to the shortcomings of current automated techniques based on HMM-based alignment or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), manual verification and labeling are often required. In this paper we present a novel technique for automatic placement of phoneme boundaries in a speech waveform using explicit statistical models for phoneme boundaries. Thus we are able to cut down substantially on the labor and time intensive manual labeling process required to build a new voice. The phonetic speech segmentation is carried out using a two-step process, similar to the way a human expert would label the waveform. In the first step an initial estimate of the labeling is generated using an HMM based phoneme recognizer. The second step refines the boundary placements by searching for the best match in a region near the estimated boundaries with predefined boundary models generated from existing labeled speech corpora. The proposed method can be used in conjunction with any of the segmentation schemes used in practice. In the performance evaluations carried out the system is able to give time marks which are 30-40\% better than the schemes currently used.},

  abstract = {A crucial step in processing speech audio data for information extraction, topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models \textendash{} for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.
Zusammenfassung
Ein wesentlicher Schritt in der Sprachverarbeitung zum Zweck der Informationsextrahierung, Themenklassifizierung oder Wiedergabe ist die Segmentierung in thematische und Satzeinheiten. Sprachsegmentierung ist schwierig, da die Hinweise, die daf\"ur gew\"ohnlich in Texten vorzufinden sind (\"Uberschriften, Abs\"atze, Interpunktion), in gesprochener Sprache fehlen. Wir untersuchen die Benutzung von Prosodie (Timing und Melodie der Sprache) zu diesem Zweck. Mithilfe von Entscheidungsb\"aumen und Hidden-Markov-Modellen kombinieren wir prosodische und wortbasierte Informationen, und pr\"ufen unsere Verfahren anhand von zwei Sprachkorpora, Broadcast News und Switchboard. Sowohl bei korrekten, als auch bei automatisch erkannten Worttranskriptionen von Broadcast News zeigen unsere Ergebnisse, da\ss{} Prosodiemodelle alleine eine gleichgute oder bessere Leistung als die wortbasieren statistischen Sprachmodelle erbringen. Dabei erzielt das Prosodiemodell eine vergleichbare Leistung mit wesentlich weniger Trainingsdaten und bedarf keines manuellen Transkribierens prosodischer Eigenschaften. F\"ur beide Segmentierungsarten und Korpora erzielen wir eine signifikante Verbesserung gegen\"uber rein wortbasierten Modellen, indem wir prosodische und lexikalische Informationsquellen probabilistisch kombinieren. Eine Untersuchung der Prosodiemodelle zeigt, da\ss{} diese auf sprachunabh\"angige, in der Literatur beschriebene Segmentierungsmerkmale ansprechen. Die Auswahl der Merkmale h\"angt wesentlich von Segmentierungstyp und Korpus ab. Zum Beispiel sind Pausen und F0-Merkmale vor allem f\"ur Nachrichtensprache informativ, w\"ahrend zeitdauer- und wortbasierte Merkmale in nat\"urlichen Gespr\"achen dominieren.
R\'esum\'e
Une \'etape cruciale dans le traitement de la parole pour l'extraction d'information, la d\'etection du sujet de conversation et la navigation est la segmentation du discours. Celle-ci est difficile car les indices aidant \`a segmenter un texte (en-t\^etes, paragraphes, ponctuation) n'apparaissent pas dans le language parl\'e. Nous \'etudions l'usage de la prosodie (l'information extraite du rythme et de la m\'elodie de la parole) \`a cet effet. A l'aide d'arbres de d\'ecision et de cha\i\^nes de Markov cach\'ees, nous combinons les indices prosodiques avec le mod\`ele du langage. Nous evaluons notre algorithme sur deux corpora, Broadcast News et Switchboard. Nos r\'esultats indiquent que le mod\`ele prosodique est \'equivalent ou sup\'erieur au mod\`ele du langage, et qu'il requiert moins de donn\'ees d'entra\i\^nement. Il ne n\'ecessite pas d'annotations manuelles de la prosodie. De plus, nous obtenons un gain significatif en combinant de mani\`ere probabiliste l'information prosodique et lexicale, et ce pour diff\'erents corpora et applications. Une inspection plus d\'etaill\'ee des r\'esultats r\'ev\`ele que les mod\`eles prosodiques identifient les indicateurs de d\'ebut et de fin de segments, tel que d\'ecrit dans la litt\'erature. Finalement, l'usage des indices prosodiques d\'epend de l'application et du corpus. Par exemple, le ton s'av\`ere extr\`emement utile pour la segmentation des bulletins t\'el\'evis\'es, alors que les caracteristiques de dur\'ee et celles extraites du mod\`ele du langage servent davantage pour la segmentation de conversations naturelles.},

How is such learning different from second language acquisition (SLA), and why is it in some ways more difficult? These are some of the questions Jeff Siegel examines in this book, which focuses specifically on second dialect acquisition (SDA). Siegel surveys a wide range of studies that throw light on SDA. These concern dialects of English as well as those of other languages, including Dutch, German, Greek, Norwegian, Portuguese and Spanish. He also describes the individual and linguistic factors that affect SDA, such as age, social identity and language complexity. The book discusses problems faced by students who have to acquire the standard dialect without any special teaching, and presents some educational approaches that have been successful in promoting SDA in the classroom.},

You will learn how speech is formulated by the speech organs. You also will learn how individual speech sounds are created and how they are combined during the speech process to form syllables and words. You will need to learn to listen to the speech patterns of words and sentences to become familiar with the sounds of speech that comprise spoken language. A large part of any course in phonetics also involves how speech sounds are transcribed, or written. Therefore, you also will be learning a new alphabet that will enable you to transcribe speech sounds. This alphabet, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), is different from most alphabets because it is designed to represent the sounds of words, not their spellings. Without such a systematic phonetic alphabet, it would be virtually impossible to capture on paper an accurate representation of the speech sound disorders of individuals seeking professional remediation. Using the IPA also permits consistency among professionals in their transcription of typical or atypical speech"--},

  abstract = {Resumo: Esta tese trata da estrutura pros\'odica do Portugu\^es Brasileiro e a compara com a estrutura do Portugu\^es Europeu. Para realizar essa compara{\c c}\~ao, s\~ao consideradas evid\^encias entoacionais, segmentais e r\'itmicas dos tr\^es dom\'inios mais altos da hierarquia pros\'odica, a saber: a frase fonol\'ogica, a frase entoacional e o enunciado fonol\'ogico. No Portugu\^es Brasileiro, n\~ao foram encontradas evid\^encias segmentais mas apenas evid\^encias entoacionais dos tr\^es dom\'inios pros\'odicos investigados. Esse resultado difere do que \'e encontrado no Portugu\^es Europeu que presenta evid\^encias entoacionais da frase entoacional e evid\^encias segmentais de ser esse um dom\'inio pros\'odico composto. As evid\^encias entoacionais dos dom\'inios no Portugu\^es Brasileiro apresentam o desafio de formalizar teoricamente o problema da manifesta{\c c}\~ao fon\'etica das varia{\c c}\~oes de altura que expressam rela{\c c}\~oes fonol\'ogicas as quais podem ocorrer entre os constituintes pros\'odicos em diferentes n\'iveis da estrutura. A an\'alise de contextos de bloqueio da degemina{\c c}\~ao e da elis\~ao revelou que, nas duas variedades do Portugu\^es, h\'a restri{\c c}\~oes que atuam no dom\'inio da frase fonol\'ogica de modo a bloquear a configura{\c c}\~ao de estruturas r\'itmicas mal formadas. Tamb\'em se verifica um efeito de direcionalidade esquerda/direita, o qual decorre de uma restri{\c c}\~ao que preserva a proemin\^encia do acento mais \`a direita da frase fonol\'ogica. As duas variedades estudadas diferem entre si nas estrat\'egias dispon\'iveis para a resolu{\c c}\~ao do choque de acentos. A considera{\c c}\~ao dos resultados da aplica{\c c}\~ao dos processos de vozeamento da mcativa, tapping, haplologia, degemina{\c c}\~ao, elis\~ao e ditonga{\c c}\~ao embasou a reflex\~ao sobre as poss\'iveis rela{\c c}\~oes entre processos fonol\'ogicos que afetam a estrutura sil\'abica e a implementa{\c c}\~ao de um padr\~ao r\'itmico preferencial. Foram apontados ind\'icios de que o Portugu\^es Brasileiro seja mais predominantemente de ritmo sil\'abico que o Portugu\^es Europeu. Essas diferen{\c c}as r\'itmicas decorrem, em certa medida, das diferen{\c c}as na organiza{\c c}\~ao hier\'arquica dos dom\'inios pros\'odicos. Desse modo, as evid\^encias encontradas revelam como a estrutura pros\'odica acaba por gerar as semelhan{\c c}as e as diferen{\c c}as entre as duas variedades do Portugu\^es},

In order to gain historical perspective, the same technique was applied to the ex-slave recordings described in Bailey, Maynor and Cukor-Avila (1991) and to recordings of five Southern European Americans born before the Civil War. In addition, Jamaicans, Hispanics of Mexican origin who spoke English as their L2, and Hispanics speaking Spanish served as control groups. Results showed that the North Carolina African Americans and European Americans were both quite stress-timed overall, with no significant difference between them. Spanish emerged as solidly syllable-timed, while Jamaican English and Hispanic English were intermediate. The ex-slaves were significantly less stress-timed than either younger African Americans or European Americans born before the Civil War. This finding suggests that African American English was once similar to Jamaican English in prosodic rhythm.},

Then, it analyzes the most frequently used approach-based on a modified Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phonetic recognizer. For this approach, a statistical correction procedure is proposed to compensate for the systematic errors produced by context-dependent HMMs, and the use of speaker adaptation techniques is considered to increase segmentation precision. Finally, this paper explores the possibility of locally refining the boundaries obtained with the former techniques. A general framework is proposed for the local refinement of boundaries, and the performance of several pattern classification approaches (fuzzy logic, neural networks and Gaussian mixture models) is compared within this framework. The resulting phonetic segmentation scheme was able to increase the performance of a baseline HMM segmentation tool from 27.12\%, 79.27\%, and 97.75\% of automatic boundary marks with errors smaller than 5, 20, and 50 ms, respectively, to 65.86\%, 96.01\%, and 99.31\% in speaker-dependent mode, which is a reasonably good approximation to manual segmentation.},

These innovations are shared by speakers of different ethnic backgrounds, and have been identified as features of Multicultural London English (MLE). This study examines whether syllable-timing is a feature of MLE, as work on rhythm shows that dialect and language contact may lead to varieties of English becoming more syllable-timed. Narratives as told by teenagers of different ethnic backgrounds and elderly speakers were segmented by forced phonemic alignment and measurements of vocalic normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI), as an indicator of rhythmic patterns, were calculated. The results revealed that young speakers of non-Anglo background were significantly more syllable-timed than young Anglo speakers and the inner-London speakers were more syllable timed than the outer London speakers. Additionally, there was a correlation between articulation rate and nPVI for the non-Anglo speakers: speakers with a high vocalic articulation rate were more syllable-timed. Changes in the duration of particular diphthongs and schwa may have influenced the overall speech rhythm. The relatively low nPVI for all speaker groups may also indicate London's status as a center of linguistic innovation due to long-standing migration.},

These varieties developed during the nineteenth century along with the immigration of settlers from Britain and Ireland. The novelty of Trudgill's theory is that these new varieties of English were predictable and deterministic according to certain demographic and linguistic principles, and that all these varieties of colonial Englishes are similar to each other because they were formed out of similar mixtures according to the same principles. Trudgill argues no role in colonial dialect development and that the work of dialect formation was carried out by children over a period of two generations. Trudgill's work represents an exciting new approach to the study of language contact and dialects in its emphasis on the notion of predictability and the important role of children.},

The subjects of the study were sixty Nigerians of varied socio-economic, educational and ethno-linguistic backgrounds and a native (British) English speaker, whose productions from reading a passage and speaking freely for three minutes on a common topic were analysed metrically and statistically, using a modified version of the Metrical Theory, the Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed Ranks Test and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In spite of earlier classifications, the study assumes the existence of three varieties of spoken Nigerian English characterized by their disposition to stress and speech rhythm: the ``Non-Standard'', the ``Standard'' and the ``Sophisticated'' varieties, which are individually different but collectively similar yet different from Standard British English, represented by the control's performance. The existence of the three varieties is confirmed by the data. The common performance features include a tendency to stress more syllables in words than the native speaker. This feature, which is traceable to the influence of the syllable-timing rhythm of the subjects' mother tongues, tends to characterize the Nigerian accent of English; but whereas the Non-Standard Variety conforms to the syllable-timing description the Standard and Sophisticated Varieties require further investigation.},

              It is common practice in sociophonetics to measure vowel formants at one (monophthongs) or two (diphthongs) time points. This paper compares this traditional
              target
              approach with two
              dynamic
              approaches for investigating regional patterns of variation: the multiple time point approach, which measures formants at successive time points, and the regression approach, which estimates formant dynamics over time by fitting polynomial regression equations to formant contours. The speech material consisted of monosyllabic words containing all full vowels of Dutch, except for /y/. These words were read out by 160 speakers of Standard Dutch, who were distributed over four regions in the Netherlands and four regions in Flanders, Belgium. The results show that dynamic approaches outperform the target approach in uncovering regional vowel differences, which suggests that sociophonetic vowel studies that apply the target approach run the risk of overlooking important sociolinguistic patterns.},

Our review summarises recent insights into the production and perception of these two components of prosody and their grammatical underpinnings.

Here we investigate the impact of listener awareness of regional sociolinguistic variation on sociolinguistic perception. Specifically, we compare how the social meanings attributed to word-internal, preconsonantal /s/ differ based on whether the listeners and speakers use predominantly /s/-weakening Puerto Rican Spanish or predominantly non\textendash/s/-weakening Mexican Spanish. We find that for measures of status, Puerto Rican and Mexican listeners both show a smaller effect of /s/ when rating Puerto Rican as opposed to Mexican speakers. However, we see no effect of speaker nationality on heteronormativity, and Puerto Rican listeners and male Mexican listeners rate strong /s/ as less heteronormative across the board. Mexican female listeners, however, rate strong /s/ as more heteronormative. These results suggest that listeners integrate their own local ideologies with their understanding of regional differences when socially evaluating language variation.},

Another approach is the detailed analysis of individual speakers in different social situations. This chapter presents an overview of these two research traditions. It provides analyses across groups and individuals in the English spoken on the island of Bequia. Two well-studied grammatical variables constitute the linguistic focus of this research: The absence of copula/auxiliary be and existential constructions. The discussion compares the linguistic conditioning of these features in the speech of individuals who have left Bequia for long periods of time with that of their stay-at-home peers.},

Previous research has indicated that listeners are sensitive to this distinction in making a forced-choice decision as to whether an utterance is a statement or a question. NZE is also characterized by an ongoing merger of the NEAR and SQUARE diphthongs, with younger speakers more likely to realize the vowel in a word such as care with a closer starting point (as in [i{\fontencoding{LEIP}\selectfont\char61}], overlapping with their realization of the NEAR vowel), whereas older speakers would have more open starting point (as in [e{\fontencoding{LEIP}\selectfont\char61}]). The current study uses the mouse-tracking paradigm to provide evidence that the realization of SQUARE with an innovative vs. a conservative variant in a word early in an utterance affects NZE listeners' sensitivity firstly to a rise as a potential signal of an uptalked statement and secondly to the early alignment of the rise as a signal of a question. This finding indicates that the interpretation of prosodic variability can depend on speaker characteristics imputed from other sociophonetic cues.},

First, we examined how well these metrics discriminated ``stress-timed'' English and Dutch and ``syllable-timed'' Spanish and French. Metrics of interval standard deviation such as {$\Delta$}V and {$\Delta$}C were strongly influenced by speech rate, but rate-normalised metrics of vocalic interval variation, VarcoV and nPVI-V, were shown to discriminate between hypothesised ``rhythm classes'', as did \%V, an index of the relative duration of vocalic and consonantal intervals. Second, we applied these metrics to quantifying the influence of first language on second language rhythm, with the expectation that speakers switching ``rhythm classes'' should show rhythm scores different from both their native and target languages. VarcoV offered the most discriminative analysis in this part of the study, with \%V also suggesting insights into the process of accommodation to second language rhythm.},

  abstract = {Sociophonetic inquiry into sexuality and the voice has often focused on the perception of men's sexuality on the basis of disembodied voices. However, inconsistencies across these studies limit our ability to unite their findings into a cohesive model of gay-sounding speech. This paper focuses on variability among gay-sounding speakers by analyzing the voices of female-to-male transgender individuals, or trans men. Trans men who make use of testosterone typically experience a significant drop in vocal pitch, yet may maintain stylistic traits acquired while living in a female social role. An acoustic and perceptual analysis of trans and non-trans men's voices reveals that even as trans men may be perceived as gay-sounding, their sociolinguistic styles also differ from those of gay-sounding non-trans men. These findings support the notion that gay-sounding speech does not constitute a single phonetic style, but rather numerous deviations from the hegemonic norm.},
