# master-research

Hello! My name is Gustavo Silveira and I'm a brazilian graduate student of Linguistics (2020 - 2021) in the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil.

I'm glad you've found this repository! Here you'll find almost everything that I'm producing in my in progress academic research for master's degree in Linguistics. I advocate open science (scientific knowledge accessible for everybody in everywhere) and I'm trying to make available for you all files, data, versions of writings, scripts (e.g., R and Praat scripts), notes, meeting agendas, bibliografies, figures, etc., of my research. With Git, you can also see all the change history of these files and have a better understanding of the real research process (with many corrections, revisions, modifications...) that was took to reach their actual state.

You're free to take, copy, modify, share or whatever (even commercially), all these data. There's only one request I make: if you are going to share some data from here (in its original version or modified by you), I ask you to always give, by citation, the source of information. More than for personal credits, correct referencing is important for us to be able to relate our own scientific work to previous ones and to find out other interesting materials.

In terms of licenses, my request puts this repository under 4.0 Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license.
