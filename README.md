# g-silveira/master-research

### Hello! My name is Gustavo Silveira and I'm a brazilian graduate student of Linguistics in the [State University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) (Unicamp) in Brazil. I'm glad you've found this repository! Here you'll find almost everything that I'm producing in my in progress academic research (2020 - 2021) for master's degree in Linguistics, under the supervision of Professor [Livia Oushiro](https://oushiro.github.io/).

#### Until now, the title of the research is this:
#### *The regional variation in the durational organization of Brazilian Portuguese: a comparative sociophonetic study of SÃ£o Paulo and Alagoas*

I advocate [open science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction) (scientific knowledge accessible for everybody in everywhere) and I'm trying to make available for you all files, data, versions of writings, scripts (e.g., R and Praat scripts), notes, meeting agendas, bibliografies, figures, etc., of my research. With Git, you can also see all the change history of these files and have a better understanding of the real research process (with many corrections, revisions, modifications...) that was took to reach their actual state. 

Data produced by other researchers will be included here only if it's available under some license that permits to share it or if its author(s) have authorized to share it. When included, the data have its source properly cited.

All files were created or manipulated using free softwares (like [LibreOffice](https://pt-br.libreoffice.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)), so you're not supposed to have problems to read them in your computer due to commercial licenses.

You're free to take, copy, modify and share all these data. There's only one request I make: if you are going to share some data from here (in its original version or modified by you), I ask you to always give, by citation, the source of the information. More than for personal credits, correct referencing is important for us to be able to track the relation of our scientific work to previous ones and to find out other interesting materials.

In terms of licenses, my request puts this repository under [3.0 Creative Commons Attribution (BY)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/br/deed.en) license.

Most of the data is written in Brazilian Portuguese, but I'll translate into English the materials that have reached a more stable and conclusive state.

Last, but not least, feel free to write me questions, suggestions, criticisms, recommendations or just to say hello. You can do it here in Github creating a new issue in the "Issues" section of this repository or you can send a message to my email (silveira.gustavocampos@gmail.com). It will be a pleasure to reply.

For the time being, that's it! Thank you for your interest!
