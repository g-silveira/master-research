# My academic research for Master's degree in Linguistics:
# The regional variation in the durational organization of Brazilian Portuguese: a sociophonetic study of the varities from SÃ£o Paulo and Alagoas

Hello! My name is Gustavo Silveira and I'm a brazilian graduate student of Linguistics in the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil.

I'm glad you've found this repository! Here you'll find almost everything that I'm producing in my in progress academic research (2020 - 2021) for master's degree in Linguistics, under the supervision of Professor Livia Oushiro. I advocate open science (scientific knowledge accessible for everybody in everywhere) and I'm trying to make available for you all files, data, versions of writings, scripts (e.g., R and Praat scripts), notes, meeting agendas, bibliografies, figures, etc., of my research. With Git, you can also see all the change history of these files and have a better understanding of the real research process (with many corrections, revisions, modifications...) that was took to reach their actual state. All data that was produced by other reseachers in other research projects have its author(s) or its source(s) properly cited. And all files were created or manipulated using free softwares (like LibreOffice Suite, R, Praat, ELAN, Audacity, etc.), so you're not supposed to have problems to read them in your computer due to commercial licenses.

You're free to take, copy, modify, share or whatever (even commercially, although I strongly suggest you to join the open and free side of the force!), all these data. There's only one request I make: if you are going to share some data from here (in its original version or modified by you), I ask you to always give, by citation, the source of the information. More than for personal credits, correct referencing is important for us to be able to relate our own scientific work to previous ones and to find out other interesting materials.

In terms of licenses, my request puts this repository under 4.0 Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license.

Most of the data is written is Brazilian Portuguese, but I will translate into English the materials that have reached a more stable and conclusive state. In the future, when the this research is completed, I will translate into English all the remainings.

Last, but not least, feel free to write me with questions, suggestions, criticism, recommendations or just to say hello. You can do it here in Github creating a new issue in the "Issues" session of this repository or you can send my an email: silveira.gustavocampos@gmail.com

For the time being, that's it! Thank you for you interest!
